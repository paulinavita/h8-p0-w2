Algorithm
1. Save a variable named mass
2. Save a variable named acceleration
3. Calculate mass time acceleration
4. Save result of calculation as variable named force
5. Show force as the result

Pseudocode
STORE "mass" with any number
STORE "acceleration" with any number

CALCULATE "mass" times "acceleration"
SET "force" value with calculation result
DISPLAY "force"

Algorithm
1. Save variable named year
2. Count the value year with year modulus 4
3. If the result is not equal to 0 then show that year is not leap year
4. If the result is equal to 0 then show that year is leap year
5. The previous result that equals to 0 is mod by 400
6. If the result is equals to 0 display year is a leap year, not display year is not a leap year
7. Insert new value for variable

Pseudocode
STORE "year" with any integer
    CALCULATE "year" mod 4
        IF the result is not equal to 0
            DISPLAY "year" is not a leap year   
        ELSE
            CALCULATE result mod 100
                IF result is 0
                    DISPLAY "year" is a leap year
                ELSE
                    CALCULATE result mod by 400
                        IF result is equal to 0
                                DISPLAY "year" is a leap year
                         ELSE
                             DISPLAY "year" is not a leap year
DISPLAY please input new "year" value

Algorithm
1. Save a variable named "clothes-amount"
2. Store its value to 0
3. Add 1 to the value "clothes-amount" until the value 20
4. Show a messagge 'Washing starts!'

Pseudocode
STORE "clothes-amount" with 0
WHILE "clothes-amount" is less than 20
    ADD "clothes-amount" by 1

DISPLAY "Washing starts!"

Algorithm
1. Save "long-nails" as a variable
2. Assign the value as true
3. Save "number of pupil" as a variable
4. Assign the value with 0
5. As long as the value of "number of pupil" is less than 40, check if "long-nails" is true
6. If the value of "long-nails" is true show a message "You're punished"
7. If the value of "long-nails" is false show a message "Good attitude!"

Pseudocode
STORE "long-nails" with true
STORE "number of pupil" with 0

WHILE "number of pupil" < 41
    DISPLAY "number of pupil"
    IF "long-nails" is true
        DISPLAY "You're punished."
    ELSE
        DISPLAY "Good attitude!"
